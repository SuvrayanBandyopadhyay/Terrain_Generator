Initially I was working on a grand strategy game. However I was unable to finish it. This repository contains the terrain generation part which was mostly complete.

The features include

1) Hills, mountains, beaches, seas and oceans
2) Rivers, whose generation are based on both height and precipitation
3) Generation of villages
